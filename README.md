# Introduction

![](<.gitbook/assets/Storj DCS Logo - Color.svg>)

## Storj DCS&#x20;

For developers who demand ownership of their data and who want to build with confidence, Storj Decentralized Cloud Storage (DCS) is private by design and secure by default—delivering unparalleled data protection and privacy when compared to traditional centralized cloud object storage alternatives.

Storj DCS offers affordable and predictable pricing, S3 compatibility, a robust library of open source technical documentation and familiar development tools - along with a vibrant user community - which enables developers to economically and easily learn and leverage decentralized cloud storage technology to take control of their data when building the next great application or service.

## Storj Decentralized Cloud Storage (DCS): The Secure and Private Decentralized Cloud Storage Service For Developers

Storj DCS is the world’s first open-source, decentralized cloud storage layer that’s private by design and secure by default - enabling developers to build in the best data protection and privacy into their applications as possible. The zero trust architecture, multi-region high availability, default encryption and edge-based access controls minimize risk and give only you, or those you grant permission to, access to your files. The result is that you take back full ownership and control of your data.&#x20;

## How it Works&#x20;

When an object is uploaded into Storj DCS, it is default encrypted, split up into 80 or more pieces and distributed across thousands of diverse nodes and ISPs in nearly 100 countries. There is no single point of failure or centralized location meaning outages, downtime, bitrot, ransomware and data breaches are virtually impossible. If a node goes offline for any reason, your file can be reconstituted from just 29 of its distributed pieces. And, in addition to user-assigned access grants to ensure privacy, our edge-based security model with delegated authorization provides flexible and ultra-secure capabilities for access management.

## Why Choose Storj DCS?&#x20;

Developers have a wide range of choices for S3-compatible object storage, but Storj DCS provides a number of key advantages to help developers build more secure and private applications:

### Security

Confidently store your data with files split, distributed, and stored multi-regionally across the globe providing no single point of failure, resistance to hacking, tampering, and bitrot, and an edge-based security model.

### Privacy

Own your data with default encryption and user-assigned access grants so no one can view or compromise your data without permission.

### Plug-in S3 Compatibility&#x20;

Swap out a few lines of code, and you’ll be up and running in minutes.

### Availability

Download your data anytime you need it with multi-region architecture, no single point of failure, and satellite-automated data orchestration. No downtime, no bitrot, and no lost files.&#x20;

### Durability&#x20;

Automate file repair and know that Reed-Solomon erasure coding enables the highest levels of durability for all files uploaded to Storj DCS.

### Cost Efficiency&#x20;
